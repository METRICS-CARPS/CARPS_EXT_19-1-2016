For this article you should focus on the findings reported in the results section for Study 1a.

Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> We calculated the averageresponse score for the allocation decisions for eachparticipant and found that those in the control condition selected the personally disadvantageous option (i.e., “Option A”) 33.88% of the time (SD = 31%), while those in the framed condition selected this option (i.e., “Agreement”) 47.90% of the time (SD = 33%). This difference was statistically significant, t(82) = 2.00, p = .049.3 As predicted, we found that the lower individual point allocation was selected more often when it was labeled “Agreement” rather than “Option A” (see Fig. 1).
